# Embedded-Systems-Portfolio
Welcome to my Embedded Systems Portfolio repository.  
This repository showcases my coursework projects, embedded systems builds, firmware development, and hardware–software integrated systems.

COURSE BASED WORKS ->

1. Mastering Microcontrollers -1
   Learnings - Driver development, Bare metal programming, I2C,SPI,UART 
   STM32F411CEU6 Driver Development
   https://github.com/Krish36518/STM32F411CEU6-MCU-1/tree/main/stm32f4xx_drivers

   STM32F411CEU6 TEST PROGRAMS ON UART,I2C AND GPIO

3.RTC ON LED
Key takeaway - Real Time operating system project showing a real time clcok on 16x2 display
https://github.com/Krish36518/Project_RealTimeClock_onLED

4.Digital Clock 
Key takeaway - A pure hardware project not using any microcontroller and generating a digital clock by making use of TTL ICs only
https://github.com/Krish36518/Digital-Clock-Using-TTL-ICs

5.Smart Cable Fault Detector
Key Takeaway - A smart cablefault detector which makes use of TDR technology and an algorith to find accurate distance in faulty wires
